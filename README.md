## Setup

1. Make sure Python >= 3.6 is installed on your local machine and create a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv retail-updates-streamer
   ```

2. Activate your virtual environment.

   ```bash
   source retail-updates-streamer/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install application packages.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your producer-consumer related config in a `.env` file.

5. For docker setup, add global environment constant in your `zshrc` or `bashrc` depending on shell.

   ```bash
   export DOCKER_KAFKA_HOST = $(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
   ```

6. Please note that I've commented out `elasticsearch` and `kibana` in `docker-compose.yml` as they need a lot of virtual environment memory. You can run these two stacks on local by downloading them as zip from official elastic site.
